# Distributed Video Processing Architecture
## Producer Side
1. Split video into chunks (you're already doing this)
2. Send each chunk to Kafka with metadata (chunk number, video ID)
3. Ensure proper ordering information is preserved

## Consumer Architecture
### WE need multiple consumers working in parallel:
1. Consumer Types:
    - Chunk Collectors: Collect chunks belonging to the same video
    - YOLOv8 Processors: Run inference on complete videos
    - (Optional) Result Aggregators: Combine results from multiple videos

2. Consumer Group Strategy:
    - Create a consumer group where each consumer gets assigned specific partitions
    - Distribute load by having multiple consumers in the group
    - Use partition assignment to ensure chunks from the same video go to the same consumer

3. Scaling Approach:
    - Scale horizontally by adding more consumers to the group
    - The number of consumers should be based on:
        - Available computing resources
        - Number of videos being processed
        - Required processing speed

# Processing Flow
1. Collection Phase:
    - Consumers collect chunks for a specific video
    - Once all chunks are received, reconstruct the video

2. Processing Phase:
    - Feed reconstructed video to YOLOv8 model
    - Run object detection on the video
    - Extract object IDs and metadata

3. Results Handling:
    - Send results to another Kafka topic for downstream processing
    - Include video ID and timestamp information

# Ensuring Unique IDs
## For YOLOv8 object detection results:
1. Object ID Generation:
    - YOLOv8 doesn't inherently provide unique IDs for detected objects
    - Implement a tracking algorithm (like SORT or DeepSORT) to maintain object IDs across frames
    - Generate globally unique IDs by combining:
        - Video ID
        - Frame number
        - Object detection index
        - Object class

2. ID Persistence:
    - ntain a mapping of object IDs across frames
    -  object tracking to follow the same object throughout the video

# Performance Considerations
1. Optimal Consumer Count:
    - Start with consumers equal to the number of available GPUs
    - Monitor processing time and adjust accordingly
    - Consider CPU-bound vs GPU-bound operations

2. Batch Processing:
    - Process multiple chunks in a batch if your GPU can handle it
    - Balance between latency and throughput

3. Resource Management:
    - Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent overwhelming consumers
    - Monitor memory usage when reconstructing videos
